# /scaffold

**Day 0 — Production Scaffold** (one-time project setup)

Generates a complete production-grade scaffold from the architecture document and Figma export.
Output: infrastructure + design system + UI shell + AGENTS.md + knowledge/.

**Goal: structure and standards, not live integrations.**
Day 0 prepares developers to follow golden paths and best practices from the very start.
Real auth providers, live databases, and external service integrations are Day 1.

- No business logic. No API wiring. No placeholder pages.
- **Auth = mock only** — login form redirects to dashboard, no real provider calls (no Supabase Auth, no NextAuth, no OAuth). Real auth is wired in Day 1.
- **Data = mock only** — all components use local mock data, no live DB queries.
- **No external service dependency** — the project must build and run without any credentials or services configured.
- The install + dev command must work out of the box (e.g. `npm install && npm run dev` for Next.js, `flutter pub get && flutter run` for Flutter).

## Prerequisites

Before running /scaffold:

1. Architecture document must be in `docs/arch-docs/`
2. Figma export ZIP must be available
3. Run: `ingest_architecture_doc` MCP tool on `docs/arch-docs/`
4. Run: `ingest_figma_zip` MCP tool on the Figma ZIP

---

## EVALUATE — Understand the Architecture and Design

Load `docs/arch-docs/` (ARCH doc + ADRs) and the Figma export. Then walk through:

**Architecture:**

1. The stack decisions and why they were made
2. The data model — tables, relationships, indexes
3. What infrastructure is needed from the start
4. The middleware stack and auth flow
5. Error response format and error handling strategy
6. Security rules and constraints

**Design:** 7. Design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, radii, shadows) 8. Component inventory (every component, variants, states) 9. Layout patterns (grid, breakpoints, responsive behavior) 10. Iconography (style, sizes, library)

**Read the design-system reference file itself, in full — not a summary of
it.** If a `knowledge/*.md` design-system doc already exists from a prior
pass, treat it as a lead, not a substitute: it can go stale or compress away
detail. Read the actual `Design System.dc.html` (or equivalent) export
directly before relying on any derived summary.

**These generated design-system pages often restate the same fact in
multiple places, and the restatements can disagree** — an early illustrative
example may show one value while the file's own underlying data (the
JS/script section actually driving the page's swatches, e.g. a `TYPE_SCALE`
or `COLORS` array) declares another. Don't stop at the first section that
seems to answer the question — read the whole file. When two statements in
the same file conflict, prefer whichever one is more specific or names an
actual file path in the codebase (e.g. "`lib/icons.jsx` now imports from
lucide-react") over a generic illustrative swatch — the specific one is
usually the more recently updated, authoritative one.

**Also check for sibling token files in the same export folder** (e.g.
`tokens.css`, `design-tokens.css`, `tailwind.config.js` alongside the `.dc.html`
files) — these can be more authoritative than the HTML page, or in rare cases
be misplaced/leftover from a different sibling app's export (verify the
palette and page names inside actually match this app before trusting one).

**Design token conversion (before writing any design file):**
Figma exports colors in oklch or hex — never copy them raw. Convert to the target stack's native format:

- Web (Tailwind v4): `hsl()` — never oklch, hex, or rgb
- Flutter: `Color(0xFF...)` or generated `color_theme.dart`
- React Native: hex strings in a `colors.ts` theme file

Do NOT generate code yet. Produce an EVALUATE SUMMARY covering all 10 points.
Stop and wait for confirmation before proceeding to PLAN.

## PLAN — Boilerplate + UI Shell + Project Rules

Based on the architecture document and Figma design, plan four things:

**1. INFRASTRUCTURE BOILERPLATE**

- Project structure — every directory, annotated
- Database schema — from the architecture doc's data model
- Environment variables — complete list, documented
- Auth flow — as specified in the architecture
- Error handling — using the format from the architecture

**2. UI SHELL (from Figma)**

- Design system config (tailwind.config.ts, globals.css, CSS custom properties, font loading)
- Component architecture (name, path, props interface, variants, composition, accessibility)
- Page layouts (every page from the Figma, structured with placeholder data)
- Build order (component dependency chain)

**3. AGENTS.md (cross-tool project rules)**

- Project description and stack summary
- Backend and frontend coding standards
- Security rules, git conventions, quality gates

**4. KNOWLEDGE DIRECTORY STRUCTURE**

- `knowledge/rules/coding-standards.md`
- `knowledge/prompts/dev/` (initial prompt templates)
- `knowledge/patterns/` (implement-and-test chain)
- Design system spec saved to `knowledge/`

Output as a blueprint. No code yet.
Stop and wait for `/apply` approval before proceeding.

## APPLY — Generate the Complete Boilerplate

Plan approved. Generate everything in one scaffold.

**MANDATORY FIRST STEP — call `resolve_package_versions` before writing any file.**

`resolve_package_versions` runs the real package manager in a temp directory and returns exact pinned versions from the lock file. Use those exact versions in the manifest — no guessing, no ranges, no AI memory.

```
Step 1 — call resolve_package_versions with all deps + stack hint from arch doc
  packages: ["next@^16", "react@^19", "@supabase/supabase-js@^2", ...]
  stack_hint: "Next.js 16 TypeScript" / "Flutter 3" / "Go" / etc.
  → returns: { "versions": { "next": "16.2.9", "react": "19.2.7", ... } }

Step 2 — write the package manifest with EXACT versions from Step 1
  npm:     package.json  — "next": "16.2.9"  (no ^ or ~)
  Flutter: pubspec.yaml  — exact version constraints
  Go:      go.mod        — exact module versions
  Rust:    Cargo.toml    — exact versions

Step 3 — run the package manager to produce the lock file
  npm install       → package-lock.json
  flutter pub get   → pubspec.lock
  go mod tidy       → go.sum
  cargo build       → Cargo.lock
```

NEVER write "latest" in any manifest.
NEVER write semver ranges (^ or ~) in the final manifest.
NEVER write patch versions from AI memory — training data is always stale.

**1. Infrastructure:**

- `.gitignore` — node_modules, .env*, build outputs, OS files
- `.env.example` — all variables documented, no real secrets
- Initial migration — exact schema from arch doc
- Auth middleware — as specified
- Error handler — consistent format from arch doc
- Health-check endpoint
- Seed script — idempotent test data
- Linter + formatter config (stack-appropriate: ESLint + Prettier for JS/TS; gofmt + golangci-lint for Go; clippy for Rust; dart format for Flutter)
- Pre-commit hooks (stack-appropriate):
  - **npm:** husky + lint-staged + commitlint
    - `package.json` must have `"prepare": "husky"` in scripts
    - Write `.husky/pre-commit` with `npx lint-staged`, then `chmod +x .husky/pre-commit`
    - Write `.lintstagedrc.json` (lint + format on staged files)
    - Write `.commitlintrc.json` with `@commitlint/config-conventional`
    - CI pipeline must set `HUSKY=0` env var — husky fails in CI without a git repo
  - **Python:** pre-commit framework with `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
  - **Go / Rust / Java:** git hooks via Makefile or pre-commit framework
- README with local setup instructions
- CI pipeline config (GitHub Actions or equivalent: lint, typecheck, test, db push)

**2. UI shell (matching Figma exactly):**

- Design system config (tailwind.config.ts, globals.css — tokens from Figma)
- **Any hand-written base selector in globals.css (`a`, `body`, `input:focus`,
  `thead th`, etc.) MUST be wrapped in `@layer base { ... }`.** Tailwind v4
  emits its own utilities into a cascade layer; an unlayered rule beats a
  layered one regardless of specificity — so a plain `a { color: ... }` will
  silently override every `text-*` utility ever applied to a link, app-wide,
  not just on hover. This is invisible when diffing declared values against
  the Figma export (which sets colors via inline `style`, immune to this),
  and only shows up once rendered — verify by checking the generated
  `globals.css` has no selector outside `@layer base`/`@theme`/`@import`.
- Icons ported from a Figma export's raw `<svg>` relying on a parent's
  `text-align: center` for centering will NOT center once run through
  Tailwind: preflight sets `svg { display: block }`, and block elements
  ignore `text-align`. Give such icons `mx-auto` (or center via flex)
  instead — don't assume `text-align: center` survives the port.
- All components with TypeScript props and ALL visual states:
  (default, hover, focus, disabled, loading, empty, error)
- All page layouts responsive to Figma breakpoints
- Semantic HTML + ARIA attributes throughout
- Placeholder/mock data — NOT real API calls
- Prop interfaces defined so Day 1 can wire real data without changing the component

**3. AGENTS.md at project root**

**4. knowledge/ directory with initial content**

**Package requirements:**

- Exact versions from `resolve_package_versions` — not from memory, not ranges
- NEVER write "latest" — it is not a version
- NEVER write patch versions from AI memory
- Run the package manager after writing the manifest to produce the lock file
- No beta, canary, or RC packages
- No deprecated packages or APIs

**Production-grade standards:**

- No placeholder pages or unused dependencies
- Auth protecting all routes that need it
- Consistent error response format throughout
- Proper logging setup (not console.log)
- Environment-based configuration (dev/staging/prod)
- Security headers configured (next.config.ts for Next.js, equivalent for other stacks)
- Database connection pooling (use pooler URL, not direct)

**Next.js 16 specifics:**

- Route proxy file is `proxy.ts` not `middleware.ts` — export function `proxy`, not `middleware`
- `tsconfig.json` must use `"jsx": "react-jsx"` not `"jsx": "preserve"`

**Do NOT implement:**

- Real auth provider integration (Supabase Auth, NextAuth, OAuth, etc.)
- Live database queries or mutations
- External service calls (email, storage, payment, etc.)
- API endpoints or business logic beyond health check
- Data fetching, form submissions, or backend interactions
- Dev tasks from the CSV — that is Day 1

**Mock auth pattern:**
The login page accepts any input and sets a session cookie (preferred over localStorage — cookies are readable server-side for route guarding). No credentials checked.

- Cookie holds the user's mock role (e.g. `mock-role=admin`), 8h expiry
- Route guard (middleware/proxy) reads the cookie and redirects unauthenticated requests to login
- Server components read the cookie to get the current session (no Context provider needed)
- All role-gating uses the mock role value — no JWT, no OAuth token
  Real auth provider replaces the cookie on Day 1.

Output as complete files. The install + dev command must work (e.g. `npm install && npm run dev` for Next.js, `flutter pub get && flutter run` for Flutter).

## VALIDATE — Validate Infrastructure + Design Fidelity

**MANDATORY FIRST STEP — run the build. VALIDATE is not started until this passes.**

Use the build command for the stack prescribed in the arch doc:

| Stack         | Build command               |
| ------------- | --------------------------- |
| Next.js       | `npm run build`             |
| Vite / React  | `npm run build`             |
| Flutter       | `flutter build apk --debug` |
| Go            | `go build ./...`            |
| Rust          | `cargo build`               |
| Java / Spring | `mvn package -DskipTests`   |

If the build fails, fix ALL errors before running any other checks. Do not proceed to the checklist until the build exits with code 0. A failed build is an automatic [BLOCKER] that overrides everything else.

---

Review everything against the architecture doc AND Figma.

**Packages:**

1. Are all dependencies on stable versions (no beta/canary/RC)?
2. Any deprecated packages or APIs in use?
3. Are versions pinned exactly in the lock file (package-lock.json / pubspec.lock / go.sum / Cargo.lock)?
4. Any known security vulnerabilities? (npm audit / flutter pub audit / cargo audit / etc.)

**Infrastructure:** 5. Does the project structure match the architecture? 6. Does the schema match the data model? 7. Are all env vars from the architecture doc present? 8. Is logging production-grade (not console.log)? 9. Are security headers and CORS configured? 10. Is database connection pooling set up?

**UI fidelity:** 11. Do components match the Figma design? 12. Responsive at 320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px? 13. All visual states render with placeholder data? 14. Accessibility — keyboard nav, WCAG AA contrast? 15. Prop interfaces typed for Day 1 wiring? 16. No business logic or API calls in components? 17. `grep` `globals.css` for any selector outside `@layer base { }` /
`@theme { }` / `@import` — an unlayered rule there silently overrides
every matching Tailwind utility app-wide (not just on hover; see
"UI shell" above). Matching declared hex/px values against the Figma
export is NOT sufficient proof of correctness — that only confirms the
_value_ is present somewhere, not that the cascade actually resolves to
it once rendered. 18. Any icon centered via a parent's `text-align: center` — confirm it
carries `mx-auto` (or sits in a flex-centered parent), since Tailwind's
preflight makes `<svg>` block-level and text-align won't center it.

**AGENTS.md + knowledge directory:** 17. Coding standards match the architecture? 18. Design system spec saved to knowledge/?

**Git hygiene:** 19. Pre-commit hooks configured and working? (husky executable + lint-staged for npm; equivalent for other stacks)

Classify every issue: [BLOCKER] / [FIX NOW] / [BACKLOG]
Fix every [BLOCKER] and [FIX NOW] before calling Day 0 complete.
